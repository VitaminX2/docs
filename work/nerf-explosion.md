# NeRF Explosion

## Image based rendering & Photorealism

## NeRF

* Implicit Representation
* Differentiable Rendering

## Limitations

* Static Scene
* Hundred of images with known poses
* Training for each scene
* Slow rendering time

## Representative studies

* Dynamic Scenes - Neural Scene Flow Fields
* Unknown Poses - BARF
* Generalization or Fast Training - IBRNet, Learned Initialization
* Fast Rendering - Baked NeRF
* Hybrid Representation - NeX
